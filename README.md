# gls-web

This is an early version of a simple demo app - do not expect any amazing effects! :D

## local environment

If you have installed node localy, you can try to start the app by:

    $ node app.js
    
For development:

    $ npm run develop
    
## docker

The docker image can be build localy:

    $ docker build -t gls-web:local .
    
or it can be pulled from dockerhub (https://hub.docker.com/r/lbacik/gls-web):

    $ docker pull lbacik/gls-web
